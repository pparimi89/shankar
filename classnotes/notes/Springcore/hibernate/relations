1. One to one

    eid                  aid
    ename                city

                         endData
    addr_id(foreign key to the address aid)

create table address(aid serial primary key, city varchar, state varchar, begin_date varchar, end_date varchar);
create table employee(eid serial primary key, ename varchar, esal integer, addr_id integer references address(aid));

select * from address
select * from employee

2. One to many

name             acct_name
city             acct_code

create table account(aid serial primary key, acct_name varchar, acct_code varchar)
create table customer(id serial primary key, name varchar, city varchar, account_id integer references account(aid))

Lazy Fetch:
   when ever we try to invoke the mapped child entity from the parent, then a query call will go and fetch the data at
   the time of invocation

Eager Fetch:
    When we try to access parent entity all the corresponding child will get loaded without invoking particular child entity.
