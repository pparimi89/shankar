Hibernate:
-------------
what is it?
---------------
    Its is an ORM(Object relational mapping) tool for the java language.
    Object relational mapping
    ------------------------
       - Its a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object oriented programming languages.
    Here the java and database are two incompatible systems and this ORM helps in converting the data between them.
    - To map the domain model to relational database, hibernate provides a framework.

    Here in hibernate the database tables will refer to classes in java, and the columns of the particular table will mapped as
    property(variable) in the model.

    - It does the database calls and relieves the developer from manual handling and object conversion of resultset.

    - To provide the details about mapping between java model and databse tables, we have configuration file and
    annotations to do these mappings.

    It will be in data access layer.

HQL(Hibernate Query language):
    Here we used to write the SQL like queries against database objects.
    HQL its object oriented version of SQL.


-----------------
Entity : The model that holds the information about the database table mapping.
Entity:
  @Entity - This annotation makes the model class as hibernate Entity
  @Table  -  This annotation will map the database table with model
  @Id - This refers a primary key to your entity.
  @Column - This annotation will hold the name of the database column name


hibernate.cfg.xml:
    This file holds the information about the
           - database driver
           - username
           - JDBC URL
           - password
           - dielect
           Will be having all our entity configurations mapped over here.


StandardServiceRegistrybuilder - This class has the capabilities to read the configuration xml file.
MetadataSources - This class has the capabilities to bootstrap the hibernate context.
SessionFactory - MetadataSources will yeild session factory. This
Query - It holds the API that can run your actual HQL queries.
