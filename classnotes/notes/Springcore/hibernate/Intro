Hibernate:
-------------
what is it?
---------------
    Its is an ORM(Object relational mapping) tool for the java language.
    Object relational mapping
    ------------------------
       - Its a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object oriented programming languages.
    Here the java and database are two incompatible systems and this ORM helps in converting the data between them.
    - To map the domain model to relational database, hibernate provides a framework.

    Here in hibernate the database tables will refer to classes in java, and the columns of the particular table will mapped as
    property(variable) in the model.

    - It does the database calls and relieves the developer from manual handling and object conversion of resultset.

    - To provide the details about mapping between java model and databse tables, we have configuration file and
    annotations to do these mappings.

    It will be in data access layer.

HQL(Hibernate Query language):
    Here we used to write the SQL like queries against database objects.
    HQL its object oriented version of SQL.
